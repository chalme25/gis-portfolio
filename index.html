          Welcome to my GIS/mapping portfolio! I'm Justin. I graduated from the
          University of Toronto from the department of geography and planning. I
          love working with: maps, programming, data, and using GIS to visualise
          geographic information in creative and informative ways. Scroll down
          to see my projects.

        <p class="description-text">
          This map dispalys all of the public washrooms in the Parkdale region
          of Toronto. My friends and family I grew up with have wondered about
          where to find public washrooms while out in the neighbourhood. I used
          data from Toronto Open Data Portal of all public washrooms in the
          city.

        <p class="description-text">
          Rottnest island is a popular travel spot in Perth, Australia. There
          are three ferry ports in the city that go to the island and finding
          which is the most convenient to take is common convesation among
          locals. I made this map to visualise which ferry port is closest to
          each suburb.

          includes clickable markers with small descriptions on each location.
